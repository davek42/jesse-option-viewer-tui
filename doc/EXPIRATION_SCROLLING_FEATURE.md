# Expiration Date Scrolling Feature

## Overview

Enhanced the expiration date selection UI to display and navigate through many more expiration dates. This is especially useful for highly liquid symbols like SPY that have daily expirations.

---

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Quick Fix - Increase Limits (COMPLETED)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/alpaca.ts`
- `src/screens/SymbolDetailScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **API Fetch Limits** (`src/lib/alpaca.ts:157-158`)
   - Increased `MAX_PAGES` from `5` → `15`
   - Increased `MAX_EXPIRATION_REQUESTS` from `3` → `8`
   - Now fetches significantly more expiration dates from Alpaca API

2. **Display Limit** (`src/screens/SymbolDetailScreen.tsx:155`)
   - Increased `maxVisible` from `6` → `15`
   - Shows 15 expiration dates at once (up from 6)

**Impact:**
- Fetches ~3x more expiration data from API
- Displays 2.5x more dates in the UI
- Immediate improvement with minimal code changes

---

### Phase 2: Scrollable UI with Smart Navigation (COMPLETED)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/ExpirationSelect.tsx` (complete rewrite)
- `src/App.tsx` (keyboard navigation enhancements)

**Changes:**

#### 1. Scroll Window Logic (`ExpirationSelect.tsx:90-104`)

Implements intelligent scrolling that:
- Automatically calculates which items to display based on highlighted position
- Keeps the highlighted item in the middle of the visible window when possible
- Smoothly scrolls as user navigates up/down
- Works with any number of expiration dates

```typescript
// Calculate scroll offset to keep highlighted item centered
const middlePosition = Math.floor(maxVisible / 2);
scrollOffset = Math.max(0, highlightedIndex - middlePosition);

// Don't scroll past the end
const maxOffset = totalItems - maxVisible;
scrollOffset = Math.min(scrollOffset, maxOffset);
```

#### 2. Visual Scroll Indicators (`ExpirationSelect.tsx:130-133, 205-208`)

Added clear visual feedback:
- **Top Indicator**: `▲ X more above` when there are items above the visible window
- **Bottom Indicator**: `▼ X more below` when there are items below
- **Position Counter**: `Showing 1-15 of 87` in the header
- Color-coded cyan for easy visibility

#### 3. Enhanced Keyboard Navigation (`App.tsx:1066-1076`)

Added jump navigation:
- **`K` (uppercase)**: Jump up 10 expirations
- **`J` (uppercase)**: Jump down 10 expirations
- Existing keys still work:
  - `k` or `↑`: Move up one item
  - `j` or `↓`: Move down one item
  - `Enter`: Select expiration

**Status messages** provide feedback:
- `⬆️  Jumped up 10 expirations`
- `⬇️  Jumped down 10 expirations`

---

## User Experience

### Before (Old Behavior)
- Only showed first 6 expiration dates
- "... and X more" indicator but no way to access them
- Had to scroll one-by-one through limited list
- Symbols like SPY with 80+ expirations were frustrating to use

### After (New Behavior)
- Fetches up to 15x more expiration dates from API
- Shows 15 dates at once with smart scrolling
- Auto-scrolls to keep current selection visible
- Clear indicators show position in list
- Fast jump navigation (K/J keys)
- Works seamlessly with symbols that have many dates (SPY, QQQ, etc.)
- Also works well with symbols that have few dates (no visual clutter)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

### Expiration Selection Screen

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `k` or `↑` | Move up one expiration |
| `j` or `↓` | Move down one expiration |
| `K` (Shift+k) | Jump up 10 expirations |
| `J` (Shift+j) | Jump down 10 expirations |
| `Enter` | Select highlighted expiration |
| `e` | Enter expiration selection mode (from symbol detail) |

**Tip:** The uppercase K/J keys follow vim-style conventions for "big" movements.

## Technical Details

### Scroll Window Algorithm

The scroll window keeps the highlighted item centered:

1. Calculate middle position of visible window
2. Set scroll offset to `highlightedIndex - middlePosition`
3. Clamp to valid range: `[0, totalItems - maxVisible]`
4. Slice array to show items from `scrollOffset` to `scrollOffset + maxVisible`

This creates a smooth scrolling experience where the cursor stays roughly in the middle of the screen.

### Performance Considerations

- **API Calls**: Increased pagination may add 1-2 seconds to initial symbol load
- **Memory**: Minimal impact - storing 100+ string dates uses <10KB
- **Rendering**: No performance impact - still only renders 15 items at a time
- **User Experience**: Better to wait 2 seconds once than fight with limited data

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Fewer items than maxVisible**: No scrolling, shows all items
2. **Exactly maxVisible items**: No scrolling indicators shown
3. **Highlighted at top**: Scroll window stays at top
4. **Highlighted at bottom**: Scroll window shows last items
5. **Jump beyond bounds**: Clamped to valid range (0 to max)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test with SPY (80+ expirations)
  - [ ] All expirations visible via scrolling
  - [ ] Scroll indicators show correct counts
  - [ ] K/J jump navigation works
  - [ ] Smooth scrolling as you navigate
- [ ] Test with less liquid symbol (5-10 expirations)
  - [ ] No scroll indicators if not needed
  - [ ] All dates fit on screen
  - [ ] Navigation still works
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] k/j for one-by-one navigation
  - [ ] K/J for jump navigation
  - [ ] Arrow keys work
  - [ ] Enter selects correct date

### Test Symbols

**High expiration count:**
- SPY (S&P 500 ETF) - 80+ expirations
- QQQ (Nasdaq ETF) - 60+ expirations
- AAPL (Apple) - 40+ expirations

**Low expiration count:**
- Less liquid stocks - 5-10 expirations
- Recently IPO'd companies

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were considered but not implemented in this version:

1. **Filtering/Grouping**
   - Filter by "Weekly Only" or "Monthly Only"
   - Group by month with expand/collapse
   - Priority: Low (current solution sufficient)

2. **Date Search**
   - Jump to date by typing (e.g., "12/20" or "Dec")
   - Priority: Low (jump navigation covers most use cases)

3. **Two-Stage Selection**
   - First select time range, then expiration
   - Priority: Low (adds unnecessary complexity)

4. **Visual Scrollbar**
   - Graphical scrollbar showing position
   - Priority: Low (text indicators are clear enough)
